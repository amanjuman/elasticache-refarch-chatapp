If you having trouble with ROLLBACK_COMPLETE. Do. follow this.
You have to create two IAM roles:

1st Role:

1. Open the Roles page in the IAM console.
2. Choose Roles.
3. Choose Create New Role.
4. Under AWS Service Roles, choose Elastic Beanstalk.
4. Select your use case "Elastic Beanstalk - Customizable"
5. Attach the AWSElasticBeanstalkEnhancedHealth and AWSElasticBeanstalkService
6. Choose Next:Review.
3. As name, type "aws-elasticbeanstalk-service-role", and then choose Next Step.
7. Choose Create Role.

2nd Role:

1. Open the Roles page in the IAM console.
2. Choose Roles.
3. Choose Create New Role.
4. Under AWS Service Roles, choose EC2 .
4. Select your use case "EC2"
5. Attach the AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier, AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier and AWSElasticBeanstalkMulticontainerDocker.
6. Choose Next:Review.
3. As name, type "aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role", and then choose Next Step.
7. Choose Create Role.

When you have done making two roles, then add both of that with Any Policy that you like to add as IAM. This case I would suggest to add these two roles with "AWSElasticBeanstalkFullAccess"
